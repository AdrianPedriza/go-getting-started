# Getting Started on Okteto with Go

This example shows how to leverage [Okteto](https://github.com/okteto/okteto) to develop a Go Sample App directly in Kubernetes. The Go Sample App is deployed using raw Kubernetes manifests.

You can follow a step-by-step tutorial in [this link](https://okteto.com/blog/how-to-develop-go-apps-in-kubernetes/) if you are using your own Kubernetes cluster. If you want to follow this sample in [Okteto Cloud](www.okteto.com), a development platform for Kubernetes applications (free developer accounts come with three namespaces, with 8GB of RAM, 4 CPUs, and 150GB Disk space each), follow [this guide](https://okteto.com/docs/samples/golang/index.html) instead.
